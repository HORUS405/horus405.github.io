### About Me:
My name is Ahmed Khaled, and I am currently pursuing a degree at the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University. I am deeply passionate about low-level programming, binary exploitation, and penetration testing.

I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, contribute to collaborative projects, and thrive on tackling complex challenges to expand my expertise. My goal is to become a dedicated security researcher, continuously learning and applying cutting-edge techniques to advance the field of cybersecurity.
